# JavaScript Studies

In this repository I plan to save everything I learned in the [JavaScript Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOMRMjHB_IEBjOW_ufr00yG1) course made by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). I am very thankful for him because of all of the free content he has uploaded. I have trully learned a lot!

In the file named "notes" you'll find in written format everything that I have learned throughout this course.
