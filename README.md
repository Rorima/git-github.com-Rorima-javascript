# JavaScript Studies

In this repository I plan to save everything I learned in the [JavaScript Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOMRMjHB_IEBjOW_ufr00yG1) playlist made by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). I am very thankful for him because of all of the free content he has uploaded. I have trully learned a lot!

In the file named "notes" you'll find in written format everything that I have learned throughout this course.

This playlist doesn't seem to have all of the basic material needed to learn JS, and sometimes it teaches a couple of advanced topics that are quite difficult to understand without the basics, so I'm going to supplement this with other resources. I'm going to list here all of the resources I used.
